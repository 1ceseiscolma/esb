Webgriffe ESB
=============

Simple, beanstalkd powered, ESB framework.

Introduction
------------

Webgriffe ESB is a PHP framework that aims to speed up the development of [Enterprise Service Buses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_service_bus).

It uses [Beanstalkd](http://kr.github.io/beanstalkd/) as a queue engine and it's built on top of popular open-sourced libraries like:

* [Amp](http://amphp.org/)
* [Symfony's Dependency Injection](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/dependency_injection.html)
* [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog)

Architecture & Core concepts
----------------------------

Integrating different systems together is a matter of data flows. With Webgriffe ESB every data flow goes, one way, from a system to another through a Beanstalkd **tube**. Every tube must have a **producer** which produces **jobs** and a **worker** which works that jobs. So data goes from the producer to the worker through the tube.

With Webgriffe ESB you integrate different systems by only implementing workers and producers. The framework will take care about the rest.

Webgriffe ESB is designed to use a single binary which is used as a main entry point of the whole application; all the producers and workers are started and executed by a single PHP binary. This is possible by using [Amp](http://amphp.org/) concurrency framework.
