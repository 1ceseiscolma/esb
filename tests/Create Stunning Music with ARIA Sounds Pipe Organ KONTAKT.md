ARIA Sounds Pipe Organ KONTAKT is a sample library that runs on the Native Instruments KONTAKT platform. You will need the full version of KONTAKT 5 or higher to use it. The library comes with 8 pipe organs, each with its own set of stops and controls. You can mix and match the stops to create your own custom organ sounds.

Another feature that sets ARIA Sounds Pipe Organ KONTAKT apart from other pipe organ libraries is the ability to control the wind noise and leakage.
